# Earlier in the semester we implemented Queue classes. Take your earlier 
# Queue class and add to it so that we can treat it as an immutable sequence.
# The rationale is that this will let us inspect items in the queue
# but we can only modify the queue with the typical push() and pop().
# methods. Your new Queue should implement collections.abc.Sequence.
# Include an "if __name__ == '__main__':" section demonstrating
# the sequence properties.
