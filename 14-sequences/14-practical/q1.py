cat = 'My cat, Lola, is black.'

# Using only sequence access and slicing, extract 
# values from the string above to produce the expected outputs shown 
# below.

# An example:
# Expected output: '.'
print(cat[-1])

# Expected output: 'b'


# Expected output: 'Lola'


# Expected output: 'yct oa sbak'


# Expected output: 'kcalb'


# Expected output: 'My cat, Lola, is black.'
# You can't just use print(cat) here. You must use indexing/slicing.
