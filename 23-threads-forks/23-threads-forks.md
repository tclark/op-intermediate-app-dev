## Session 23 :  Threading and Forking

### Introduction
Two things that can slow a process down
  1. Waiting for I/O (I/O bound)
  2. Heavy computational load (CPU bound)

We can improve performance in some of these cases using concurrency and/or parallelism.
  - If our process is waiting on I/O, then we can use concurrency to do something else while waiting
  - Sometimes a complex computation can be divided into multiple parts that be run in parallel.
  - These techniques can yield great performance gains, but they are somewhat complex and can lead to difficult bugs.

**Example: Slow Code**

This code, unsurprisingly, spends most of its time waiting.
  ```
from time import sleep

def slow(x):
    sleep(10)
    return x

def do_tasks(num):
    for n in range(num):
        slow(n)

do_tasks(5)
```
This code is very slow since we call sleep(), wait for it to finish, and then call it again repeatedly.

### Basic Threading
```
import threading
from time import sleep
      
def slow(x):
    sleep(10)
    return x
    
def do_threaded_tasks(num):
    threads = []
    for n in range(num):
        t = threading.Thread(target=slow, args=(n,))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    # this next bit is optional
    for t in threads:
        t.join()

do_threaded_tasks(5)
```

### Thread Pools
```
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from time import sleep

def slow(x):
    sleep(10)
    return x

def do_threaded_tasks(num):
    tasks = list(range(num))
    results = None
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as ex:
          results = ex.map(slow, tasks)
    return results

do_threaded_tasks(5)
```
One thing this code does that the previous example did not it collect the return values of the calls to slow().

### Race Conditions
```
def slow(x, results):
    sleep(10)
    results.append(x)
    
def do_threaded_tasks(num):
    threads = []
    results = []
    for n in range(num):
        t = threading.Thread(target=slow, args=(n,results))
        ...
      
do_threaded_tasks(5)
```
Now we can get at the results, but there may a problem. All the running threads write to the shared results list in an uncontrolled way. This can lead to *race conditions*. However, it turns out the Python lists are *thread safe*.

### Locking

When threads work with shared memory we need a way to control access. One basic way to to that is locking.

Suppose that lists were not thread safe.

```
import threading

class ResultList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.results = []
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
          
    def append(self, result):
        with self._lock:
            self.results.append(result)
```

###  A Note About Python Threads
We tend to think of threads as running concurrently. In some languages that’s true, and so threads can speed up code that is I/O bound or CPU bound. In standard Python implementations, however, threads are not truly concurrent. This means that they’re really only useful for speeding up I/O bound code.

### Multiprocessing
  - Processes can run on other cores and thus run in parallel.
  - Since each task is run in a separate process with its own memory, race conditions are less of an issue, but it also means that it is harder to share information.
  - The number of processes that can run at one time is limited to the number of cores on the host


### Process Pools
```
from time import sleep
from multiprocessing import Pool
from time import sleep

def slow(x):
    sleep(10)
    return x
          
def do_multiprocess_tasks(num):
    tasks = list(range(num))
    results = None
    with Pool() as p:
        results = p.map(slow, tasks)
    return results
          
do_multiprocess_tasks(5)
```

### Programming Activity
  1. Pull the course materials repo
  2. Create a new branch, `23-practical` in your **practicals** repo.
  3. From the course materials repo, copy the contents of the `23-practical` directory.
  4. Do the first two problems now.  We will discuss them in about 20 minutes.
