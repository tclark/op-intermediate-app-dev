# Write a Subject class with a _rand_state attribute. Include a method
# that sets _rand_state to a random number between 0 and 100. Create three
# Observer objects that can observe your Subject that report the following
# conditions:
#
#  One prints a message any time the Subject's rand_state changes.
#  One prints a message when the Subject's _rand_state is set to a value over 80.
#  One prints a message when the Subject's _rand_state is set to a value under 20.
