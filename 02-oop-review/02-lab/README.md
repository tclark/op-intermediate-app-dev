## 02 Practical

Today's practical uses a *Jupyter Notebook*, a sort of Python sandbox development environment run through your browser. If you are using a lab machine or if your have Anaconda installed on your machine, you can run the notebook with either the command `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`. Run this command in your computer's Anaconda prompt.

If you are using a typical installation of Python instead, you probably need to install Jupyter first with the command `pip install --user jupyter`. Then you can use the `jupyter lab / jupyter notebook` command.
