# Create a Dog class with the private attributes name, age & breed. For
# each attribute, create a getter & setter using the @property decorator.
#
# Modify the main() function to create two Dog objects. Using setters, change
# the first Dog object's name to Fido & age to 10. Again, using a setter,
# change the second Dog object's breed to poodle. For each Dog object,
# print its name and breed.
