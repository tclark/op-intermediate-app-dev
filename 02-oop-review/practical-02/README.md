## 02 Practical


There are multiple Python files, `q1.py - q3.py`. Each one contains a programming problem to solve. Before you start work, create a branch, `02-practical`. Work on this branch, commiting and pushing your changes as you go. Once you have completed all the problems and pushed your final commit, open a pull request on GitHub, selecting `tclark` as a reviewer. Do not merge your own pull request.
