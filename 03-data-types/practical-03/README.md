## Practial 03

There are multiple Python files, `q1.py - q7.py`. Each one contains a programming problem to solve. Before you start work, create a branch, `03-practical`. Work on this branch, commiting and pushing your changes as you go. Once you have completed all the problems and pushed your final commit, open a pull request on GitHub, selecting `tclark` as a reviewer. Do not merge your own pull request.

For problems 4 - 7 you will need to consult the Python documentation about the various methods available on collection types. Links to relevant documentation are below.
