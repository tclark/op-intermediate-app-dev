# You wrote a singelton-based implementation of a random number generator for
# question 2. Now write a RandomGeneratorPool class. Instead
# of always returning the same instance, maintain a pool of up to three
# instances. 
# The first time we call RandomGeneratorPool(), there aren't any instances so it will
# create one and return it. The second and third time we call it it will also create and
# return new instances. But the fourth time we call it, and every time thereafter, it 
# will just return one of the three instances it has already created.

class RandomGeneratorPool:
    pass
