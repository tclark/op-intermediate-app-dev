# Write a Python function decorator that implements the UppercaseDecorator
# idea from demodeco.py. In this case, though, it doesn't wrap an entire
# class, it just can decorate any function that returns a string. This new
# version has an added twist: Using something like a pseudorandom number,
# only uppercase the return value about half the time.
# Include an if __name__ == '__main__' block that demonstrates the use of your decorator.
