# For this question you will write a function decorator that takes an integer
# argument. This decorator should be applicable to functions that return
# integers. Your decorator will produce a function that takes the original
# functions return value, multiply it by the value supplied as an argument to
# the decorator, and return that. Don't forget to handle possible arguments
# to the decorated function.
