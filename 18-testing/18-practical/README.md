# Practical  18: Testing

Complete the exercises below by adding code to the file `tests/test_practical.py`.

## Using `unittest`

1. Write a unit test that tests `Practical18`'s `__str__()` method.

2. Write a unit test that tests `Practical18`'s `add_stuff()` method.

3. Write a unit test that tests `Practical18`'s `add_colour()` method.

**Stop here**. We will discuss solutions in class.

## Homework

4. Write a unit test that verifies that `Practical18`'s `add_colour()` method  raises an exception if a 
disallowed colour is added.

5. Complete the test cases for the `Practical18` class. Be sure to include tests that cover both normal and error conditions (e.g., cases where a function is called with incorrect values.





You can run your tests with the command

  `python -m unittest tests/test_practical.py`

or 

  `python -m unittest tests/test_practical.py -v  (for verbose)`

from this directory
